Welcome to Design Community, these are the instructions to making it run
1. Clone the repository
2. client consists of all the React code (where changes are actually to be made)
3. After changes have been made in client run ```npm run build```
4. A build folder is generated in client. Cut and paste the build folder to server. 
5. In the server folder: 
---
  5.1 ```git add .```
  5.2 ```git commit -m ""```
  5.3 ```git push```
  5.4 Note: The server folder is linked to a different github repository (```ucsddesignco/design-community-server```)
----
6. Heroku is configured to have automatic deployment with ```ucsddesignco/design-community-server```. The changes should be reflected on community.ucsddesign.co in under five minutes. 

I will try to make the process a lot more streamlines soon :)
